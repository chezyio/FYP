## Project Overview

This final year project focuses on developing a deep learning solution to enhance and manipulate bokeh effects in images, aiming to produce photorealistic results. The primary goal is to create a system capable of both adding realistic bokeh to images, simulating professional camera defocus effects, and removing bokeh to restore sharp details. Leveraging advanced neural rendering techniques, the project will explore deep learning models inspired by recent advancements in bokeh rendering, such as convolutional neural networks and diffusion models. The solution targets applications in computational photography, enabling users like photographers and graphic designers to enhance or refine images for artistic or professional purposes.

## Project Objectives

Create a Custom Dataset: Generate a high-quality, diverse dataset of paired images (with and without bokeh) using Unreal Engine, containing samples across varied scenes, lighting conditions, and aperture settings, to support robust model training and evaluation

Develop a Web Application for Bokeh Manipulation: Create a web-based application using modern web technologies that allows users to upload images, apply or remove bokeh effects, and adjust parameters like aperture size

## Features and Requirements



## Tasks and Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Setup and Dataset Preparation

#### Task 1.1: Initial setup

-   Set up development environment
